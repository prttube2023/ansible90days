## Little bit of Git
When you faced the following problem >
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again. hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details. 

This issue usually occurs if you initialized a new github repo with README and/or LICENSE file
Best thing is to get this synched 1st locally, followed by Pull and Push
1- git remote add origin <your repo URL>
2- git pull origin master
3- git push origin master

This is gonna reolve above problem

``` bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin **<YOUR URL>**
git pull --rebase origin master
git push -f origin master
```
